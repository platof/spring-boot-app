## DevOps Engineer Task

As a DevOps Engineer at Crewmeister, you will be in charge of several challenging tasks in your daily work. One of your core responsibilities will be to ensure that the system is always running smoothly and that the application is deployed successfully to our customers.

In this challenge, you should use DevOps best practices to architect and implement the complete cycle of building, packaging, and deploying a Java application (specified later in this document). 

The following are core technologies/tools that should be present in the solution:

- Dockerfile
- Helm Chart
- Terraform to interact with the Kubernetes cluster

## Plus:

- Create a CI Pipeline in Github to automate the application lifecycle

- Add monitoring tools to check the health of the application

## Important Points:

- At Crewmeister, we value creativity and pushing for better. You are encouraged to expand the solution as you find fit. To do so, you must ensure high-quality documentation and that the base solution is correctly executed.
